# it deploys a ingress controller pod (an nginx server) to monitor ingress rules and operate based on that
# it also creates an external ip (a public ip on azure) by default and assign it to the default load balancer (in node resource group) created as part of cluster creation.
# when adding ingress object (routing rules), rules are added to the nginx config followed by a reload for rules to take effect
